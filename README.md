# Open

An open source experiment to see what an open source political party might look like.

The project will be hosted on GitHub and controlled by a committee.


## Feature 1

Policy discussion and wiki style solution proposal, all topics covered (even the tough ones).

You can ‘fork’ policies, edit and submit your amendments for vote up, vote down or discussion.

Mechanism to link examples of successful policy in other countries.


## Feature 2

Manifesto creation for what an open source political party might like like.


## Feature 3

Votes on what’s going through parliament right now, kind of like YouGov to show how the party would have voted.


## Feature 4

Local council - what’s trending as important in each constituency?

How would the party handle these problems that are important to a set of people specific to one locale?


## Funding

Not for profit, crowd sourcing for advertising only.

This is an experiment in it’s own right as an open political party might use crowdfunding to power itself without being beholden to big business.
